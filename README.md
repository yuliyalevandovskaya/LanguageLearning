Mini version of a language learning desktop application.
The application helps to practise vocabulary. It has the following features:
-	Add new words to practise (the user can add them one at a time or load a file with words)
-	Delete words (each word has a counter which increases by 25% every time the user provides a correct translation, which helps to separate the words the user knows from the rest, without scrolling through the whole list)
-	Two types of exercises:
Normal – displays all words from the list in random order
Intelligent – allows the user to choose the number and the category of words to practise.

The application was created using the following:
-JAVA – programming language
-Swing – for user interface
-JDBC
